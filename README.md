EHRServer is the first open source Clinical Data Management and Sharing Platform, compliant with the [openEHR standard](https://specifications.openehr.org/). Use it as a:

  * Primary clinical data repository for web and mobile clinical apps.
  * Secondary repository for backup or analysis.
  * Centralized repository to share clinical information between many systems.
  * Fast prototyping of new health related apps, removing the need of creating the clinical repo yourself.
  * Main or proxy repository for wearable and other monitoring-based clinical data.
  * Standardized aggregation repository as a data source for ETL to datawarehouses and analytics tools.
  * Research and training clinical data repository.
  * Backend for Clinical Decision Support tools (e.g. rule engines)


EHRServer was designer for developers by developers. You don't need to be an openEHR guru to use it. Easy to install, use, manage and integrate.

## Quick architecture reference

  * REST API provides services to integrate the EHRServer to your systems and apps ([documentation](https://cloudehrserver.com/learn)).
  * Web Console provides a user interfaces for administrators of the EHRServer (check the screenshots above).
  * Query Builder is the component in charge of creating, managing and executing queries over openEHR data stored in the EHRServer.
  * SNOMED Query is a component in charge of processing the terminologic constraints in queries that contain SNOMED CT Expressions. This component is part of the [SNQUERY](https://snquery.veratech.es/) tool developed by [VeraTech](https://www.veratech.es/)
  * EHR Base is where data is managed, indexed, versioned and stored.

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ppazos/cabolabs-ehrserver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ppazos/cabolabs-ehrserver) -->
</div>


## Want to try EHRServer?

  * [Installing EHRServer](https://cloudehrserver.com/learn/try_it)
  * [Subscribe to CloudEHRServer](https://cloudehrserver.com/pricing)
  * Run with docker-compose:
    1. $ grails war
    2. $ cd docker-compose
    3. $ docker-compose up
    4. localhost:8080 will be Adminer (a MySQL manager) (default user: ehrserver2/ehrserver2)
    5. localhost:8888 will be Tomcat (running EHRServer) (default user: admin@cabolabs.com/admin)
    6. Change the ports and SMTP configuration in the docker-compose file (optional, for user management like password reset)


## Quick install, configure, run locally (step by step)

This guide is based on a Linux environment, should be adapted for other OS.

### Dependencies

  1. curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash
  2. source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
  3. sdk install grails 3.3.10
  4. set version by default: Y
  5. grails -version

Note: Grails should be 3.3.10!

### Database for development

  Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

  MySQL >= 5.7
  
  1. sudo mysql -u root
  2. CREATE DATABASE ehrserver2;
  3. exit

  MySQL < 5.7

  1. from the installation process, copy the default root password
  2. ./mysql -u root -p
  3. enter default root password, and proceed to change it
  4. ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW-ROOT-PASSWORD';
  5. CREATE DATABASE ehrserver2;
  6. exit

  On any version you can also create a non-root user and use that to access your EHRServer database.

  1. create user 'user'@'localhost' identified by 'your_password';
  2. grant all on ehrserver2.* to 'user'@'localhost';
  3. select host, user from mysql.user;
  4. exit
  5. mysql -u user -p


### EHRServer configuration

  1. nano ehrserver/conf/application.yml
  2. change development password to NEW-ROOT-PASSWORD
  3. save

### EHRServer environment variables

  Mandatory:

      export EHRSERVER_REST_SECRET="6067dba9-1417-41c5-b1af-92208c77ce77"
